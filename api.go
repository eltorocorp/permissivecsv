// Scanner provides an interface for permissively reading CSV input. Successive
// calls to the Scan method will step through the records of a file, skipping
// terminator bytes between each record.
//
// Terminators (line endings) can be any (or a mix) of DOS or unix endings
// (\r\n or \n, respectively). When scanning, the scanner looks for the next
// occurence of both a '\r\n` and a `\n`. Whichever token is encountered first
// is presumed to be the current record terminator. This process is repeated
// for each record that is scanned.
//
// Once a record is identified, it is split into fields using standard CSV
// encoding rules. A mixture of quoted and unquoted field values is permitted,
// and fields are presumed to be separated by commas. The first record scanned
// is always presumed to have the correct number of fields. For each subsequent
// record, if the record has fewer fields than expected, the scanner will pad
// the record with blank fields to accomodate the missing data. If the record
// has more fields than expected, the scanner will truncate the record so its
// length matches the desired value. Information about padded or truncated
// records is made available via the Summary method once scanning is complete.

// offset where the partition ends, and the segment size, which is the

// If ignoreHeaderCheck is excluded or false (the default behavior), Partition

// first record in the first segment, regardless of if it is a header or not.
