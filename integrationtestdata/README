The files in this directory have a one to one correspondence with integration
tests in integration_test.go.

The data in these files may need to be edited through a hex editor or similar
tool that grants control over non-standard control character use. In other words
these files probably won't look right in a standard csv editor, so just edit
them in a hex editor.
